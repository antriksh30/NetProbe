# NetProbe - Real-time Network Packet Analysis Tool

NetProbe is a powerful Python-based tool for real-time network packet analysis. It provides comprehensive capabilities for capturing, analyzing, and visualizing network packets. Leveraging TCP/IP protocols, NetProbe intercepts and inspects network traffic, offering valuable insights into packet details such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, packet lengths, DNS queries, and DNS responses. With interactive histograms and pie charts, it facilitates the visualization of packet distribution and protocol usage. NetProbe also calculates essential network performance metrics, making it an indispensable tool for network administrators and analysts.

## Features

- Real-time packet capturing: NetProbe captures network packets in real-time, allowing for immediate analysis and monitoring.
- Packet analysis: It extracts key information from each packet, including source and destination IP addresses, protocols, packet lengths, DNS queries, and DNS responses.
- Visualizations: NetProbe provides interactive histograms and pie charts to visualize the distribution of packet lengths and protocol usage, aiding in network analysis and monitoring.
- Statistical calculations: The tool calculates essential network performance metrics such as packet rate, average packet length, and average bandwidth utilization, providing quantitative insights into network behavior.
- User-friendly interface: NetProbe offers an intuitive user interface that presents packet information in a tabular format, making it easy to navigate and interpret captured network data.
